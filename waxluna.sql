INSERT INTO `blog` VALUES (2,1,'WaxLuna Games','Welcome to WaxLuna Games.  My name is Jason Marshall, and I am building a game.  I\'ve called it PowersRPG, and it\'s a superhuman game.  And it\'s still in heavy development.  But let me give you a small tour of it.\r\n\r\n## History Behind Powers\r\nI always loved playing the old [Marvel Superheros Role Playing Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Heroes_(role-playing_game)).  But I was never as proficient in the Marvel lore, especially since the the game used lore from the 80\'s.  So I created my own lore, my own world history, all the good things.  It was good, I started it several times with my friends.  But then I found a problem.\r\nSome games just aren\'t made for specific types of characters.  And when you make the adjustments for the characters, you lose any reason for the point of the game.  In the case of Marvel RPG, that was being a hero.  And in the time since that game was published, we had a hero created who breaks the rules.  That character was Deadpool.\r\nDeadpool killed whomever he needed.  And that doesn\'t work in the game.  You lose your Karma when you kill unnecessarily.  And then the Venom movie came out, and I lost all control.  I had a player who wanted to play as something like Venom as a hero, and they were not going to be able to play as a hero if the hero kills.  I asked if they wanted something else, and they came at me with Deadpool, complete with the killing.  Yikes.\r\nSo in the grief of trying to play this game, I just started thinking about a system that was as simple to play and run but didn\'t get broken because someone wanted a killer hero.  And then I wanted something that I could play with a different setting.  And so, Powers was born.\r\n\r\n## Development Process\r\nI sat down at my computer in the middle of a dry-spell in my gaming career.  I was having a hard time getting a group together while I had a schedule that changed with the slightest whim.  I was mad and frustrated, and I thought about the last game I tried to run, my failed Marvel game.  So I opened a spreadsheet and started there.  I realized that you can learn plenty about a game when you go through character development.  So I plotted out abilities, how powers get listed out, skills for your character, and as much as I could steal from Marvel as I could.  turns out, not much.\r\nMarvel used a system fans have taken to calling FASERIP after the acronym of the attributes.  I moved the attributes around and merged a couple to come up with a different attribute system.  And then I thought about the grid FASERIP used to determine successes.  A great idea, easy to use, but was going to be difficult to make my own.  So I got rid of it.  I decided on a few d10\'s and a series of pluses and minuses to determine additional dice to roll.\r\nSo now we\'re decided on the basic resolution dynamic, how about building a character?  I took some inspiration from the Columns in Marvel.  Different classes of characters earned their stats based on a table that you rolled on and it gave you scores.  Some, stronger than others.  So I came up with Origins and Source of Powers.  Origins are what exactly you are, human alien, cyborg, extra-dimensional, etc.  Each Origin has different bonuses and weaknesses.  And the Source of Power is the method in which you get the powers.  Players can story it up, but the basic idea is the same.  Some sources give a weakness too, like a talisman.  Without the talisman, they are powerless.\r\nOne of the things I liked from the Marvel game was the idea of Karma.  Points you had to activate and use your powers, but also acted as your experience.  To use a power in a scene, pay a point.  To increase a power or skill for a roll, pay ten points.  Wanted to do it on a permanent basis?  There was a scale, I don\'t remember, but it was there.  You did have to be careful not to run to zero, as that was a good way to render yourself powerless.  And here is where I had a problem that broke the game.  In the rules, everybody that played was a hero.  And you did heroic things.  Heroic things like NOT killing your opponent.  If you killed when you didn\'t need to, the rules actually were to lose all Karma points.  That was all well and good until I had someone play a character based on the version of Venom seen in the movies where he is more of a hero than a villain.  But still ate people.  My player did just that and I realized they were going to be without Karma for the majority of the game.  And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that characters built off Deadpool would be the same way.  So I decided in Powers there wouldn\'t be this restriction.  And in taking away this restriction, I\'ve opened the door for players to play villainous characters as well.  Problem solved.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nSo here I was with a world of my making and the basic idea of a system.  So I started to write some of the things that would make the world work.  And I had a thought.  What if the world rules were separated?  In doing that, I could create other settings with the rules.  Maybe make a few changes, like running a Wild West game won\'t have computers so no technology skills.  And another thought, what if someone wanted to play in an existing franchise?  Rules can be changed from setting to setting to allow the different aspects of it.  And I could run prints of each setting independent of the books.  I came up with an idea to also create a setting that played in the history I was building.  And thought, a Wild West setting would be super fun as well.  Those are settings that are on the Roadmap.  I would like to get some licensed properties, but let me get published first.\r\n\r\nSo that\'s all I have for you all right now.  Be sure to check back soon when I will be talking about the different powers I\'ve come up with for the game.

Meet Jason','Hello to all my readers! Have you wondered who is behind WaxLuna Games? Wonder no more!\r\n## Jason Marshall and Why He Is Here\r\nMy name is Jason and I run WaxLuna Games. I\'m also the primary author on Powers RPG, a Tabletop Role Playing Game based around superheros. I have a couple of other games that I\'m working on, but nothing far enough in to discuss here.\r\n## Gaming Pedigree\r\nI have been gaming for a number of years. I played D&amp;D with a friend way back in elementary school, but didn\'t really know what I was doing. In 8th grade, someone tried to get me into it again. High school, Magic. But that was when it first started getting rather competitive. But then around 2001-ish, a friend convinced me to get in on some White Wolf games. I was hooked at that point. So I\'ve been playing various games from then. And if I haven\'t played it, good chance I know something about it.\r\n## What Else Does Jason Do?\r\nSleep.\r\nIn all honesty, I\'m a web software developer and Linux technician. This website, all the back-end tools for WaxLuna, I developed them all and I manage the hosting. So I have that going for me, which is nice. I\'m also a big fan of Sci-Fi, cartoons, indie movies. And even though I don\'t read many comic books, I love me some movies and tv based on them.\r\n## What Will Jason Be Doing Here?\r\nI run the show, I write Powers. Any more added to my belt, I\'ll let y\'all know.','2022-10-10 14:39:25','2022-11-16 17:03:50','about-jason-marshall','Want to know more about Jason?

This is a world that I have been building up for some years now.\r\n## History of the Story\r\nMany years ago, TSR Games released [MARVEL SUPERHEROS ROLEPLAYING GAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Heroes_(role-playing_game)).  A friend of mine had been running games in this system for many years, so when he offered me and some friends to play along, I jumped at the chance.  And when I wanted to run a game in the system, I had a problem.  I wasn\'t exactly well versed in the Marvel lore, especially the lore up to the point of the games release.  So I scrapped it all.  I took some elements of the games that my friend ran and used them as a background in the world that I was building on.  And it all ran in the same system Marvel ran in.  Of course there were a few powers that were Marvel specific, but those were for me and my friends.\r\n## Background of Infinite Oblivion (the actual story that you all came for)\r\nIn the 1970\'s, a young man by the name of Gideon rose to power as a super villain.  He wanted anarchy, chaos, destruction of that which catered to his madness.  He amassed an army and terrorized America.  But it didn\'t take long for some heroes to rise up to the challenge.','2022-11-02 21:48:12','2023-02-02 18:10:36','infinite-oblivion','Want to know more about the default setting of Power RPG?
